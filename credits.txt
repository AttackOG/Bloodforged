A huge massive thank you in particular to Stephen Ulibarri and his company, Druid Mechanics. He is a online instructor teaching coding and unreal engine. He has helped me achieve my dreams and goals and taught me so much allowing me to develop my skills. Stephen, none of this could be possible without you and the community you have built. I really appreciate you, and thank you. Check out his content here.
